# Hello, friend!

I'm Maria Pasca, a TUC-N Computer Science and Information Technology graduate.

Ever since I was a child I had an affinity towards learning and solving puzzles that I kept with me all these years and it didn't falter one bit.

I'm an avid learner of anything computer science related, mostly focusing on computer graphics and algorithms as I find them extremely exciting and creative subjects.
