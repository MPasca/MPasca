# Hello!

I'm Maria Pasca, a TUC-N Computer Science and Information Technology graduate. Currently I'm pursuing a Master's degree in Artificial Intelligence and Vision at the same university, where I also teach Graphic Processing labs at 3rd year Computer Science students.

Ever since I was a child I had an affinity towards learning and solving puzzles that I kept with me all these years and it didn't falter one bit.

I'm an avid learner of anything computer science related, mostly focusing on computer graphics and algorithms as I find them extremely exciting and creative subjects.
