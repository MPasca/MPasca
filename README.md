# Hello, friend!

I'm Maria Pasca, a fourth year computer science student at TUCN. Ever since I was a child I had this giddiness when discovering something new or solving a puzzle that I kept with me all these years and it didn't falter. That's what pushed me towards this field; even if at times it seems neverending, once I reach the finish line I get a rush of adrenaline and joy that's worth all the stress and mental gymnastics needed in finding the solution.
 
I'm an avid learner of anything computer science, but mostly focusing on computer graphics, as I find it extremely exciting and creative. I feel like this medium provides me with a sandbox full of opportunities to combine four of my favourite pass times, puzzles, reading, drawing and video games.
My experience ranges from working in ASM to create a pacman clone, to working with OpenGL to create and render an interactive 3D scene, to working in Unity with C# to create a 3D mini-game.
