# Hello, friend!

I'm Maria Pasca, a TUCN Computer Science and Information Technology graduate currently pursuing a master's degree in Artificial Intelligence and Computer Vision at the same University, where, starting from October, I will also teach Graphics Processing and Computer Assisted Graphics laboratories.

Ever since I was a child I had an affinity towards learning and solving puzzles, that I kept with me all these years and it didn't falter one bit.

I'm an avid learner of anything computer science related, but mostly focusing on computer graphics, as I find it an extremely exciting and creative subject. I feel like this medium provides me with a sandbox full of opportunities to combine four of my favourite pass timesâ€”puzzles, reading, drawing and video games.

My experience ranges from working in ASM to create a pacman clone, to working with OpenGL to create and render an interactive 3D scene, to working in Unity with C# to create a 3D mini-game, culminating with creating my own 2D game engine centered around maze generation and dynamic path finding, that combines Algorithms and Data structures with Artificial Intelligence, Rendering and Gamification notions, all written in C++ using the SDL library for facilitating the communication with the other hardware elements.
